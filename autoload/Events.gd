extends Node
## Global signal bus.
##
## Systems emit and connect here instead of reaching through the scene tree,
## so nothing needs deep node paths like get_node("../../..").
## Signals are added as each milestone needs them; M0 ships the bus empty.

## M1: a block became a live physics body, either placed by a player or
## auto-dropped when its feed timer ran out.
signal block_placed(block: RigidBody3D, shape_id: StringName)

## M1: a block left the simulation (kill plane for now; despawn/body-cap
## reasons arrive later). `reason` is a short machine-readable tag such as
## "kill_plane".
signal block_removed(block: RigidBody3D, reason: String)
